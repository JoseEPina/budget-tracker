# Budget Tracker (Progressive Web Application)

![License Badge](./public/images/badge.svg)

## Description

The purpose of this project is to update an existing budget tracker application by providing offline access and functionality. After offline persistence is added, the application allows the user to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection to the internet. If the user enters transactions offline, the total is updated when they're brought back online.

The application uses [IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) for client-side storage of transactions made offline. This is made possible through the use of service workers and manifests that give the application offline functionality from cached data on front-end and back-end. Once the application comes back online, the transaction data is uploaded to the [MongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) database. Also, because this is a mobile-first application, the web manifest allows users to install the app on the home screen with the app's metadata.
